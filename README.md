This library is needed for writing utilities that will synchronize your notes via Git. The difference from existing plugins is that here there is its own configuration file containing a scalable system of iterators with custom JavaScript code or built-in ones, secure storage of access tokens, paths, emails, etc., under validation that immediately reports any issues.
