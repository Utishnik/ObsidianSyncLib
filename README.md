This library is intended for creating utilities to manage and synchronize your notes. It is a versatile toolkit for working with notes, featuring a flexible configuration system based on iterators. These iterators can be extended with custom JavaScript code or used with built-in ones. Sensitive data such as access tokens, file paths, and emails are stored securely, and the built-in validation system immediately reports any configuration issues.
